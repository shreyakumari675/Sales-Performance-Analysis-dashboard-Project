# Sales-Performance-Analysis-dashboard-Project
This project is a comprehensive Sales Analysis Dashboard that provides valuable insights into the performance of a retail business in the United States. It begins by cleaning and preparing the sales dataset, handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues. Next, it conducts data analysis, calculating key metrics such as total sales, average revenue, and overall sales growth for the years 2020 and 2021. The dashboard uses various data visualization techniques, including bar charts, pie charts, and line plots, to showcase sales distribution by retailers, products, regions, and operating metrics. It allows users to interactively explore and understand sales performance, aiding in data-driven decision-making for the business.
